You should run a benchmark test or two. There are plenty available.

cd /usr/local/share/lammps/bench
lammps -in in.lj
# with mpi
mpiexec -n 2 lammps -in in.lj

To use the Python module with Python, you may need to amend your
PYTHONPATH like:
  export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH


Python modules have been installed and Homebrew's site-packages is not
in your Python sys.path, so you will not be able to import the modules
this formula installed. If you plan to develop with these modules,
please run:
  mkdir -p /Users/gstew/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
  echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' >> /Users/gstew/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/homebrew.pth
